# MrCleansTodo

This is version 3 of my personal todolist syntax.

Version 1 was made for TextMate. Version 2 was made for Sublime Text 2. Version 1 and 2 were not under source control.

## Gamification

Days that I've done a lot are tagged with "Supereffektiv" (super efficient), "Ninjaeffektiv" (ninja efficient), or "Godlike" (Unreal Tournament reference). The names are silly, but that doesn't matter. These tags, applied at the end of each day, help me aim to accomplish a lot in a day by celebrating the small checks. Checking boxes always feels good.

- "~ Supereffektiv" (super efficient) is used for days where I check 20 or more boxes, this usually happens 3-4 times a week.
- "~ Ninjaeffektiv" (ninja efficient) is used for days where I check 30 or more boxes, this usually happens once a week.
- "~ Godlike" is used for days where I check 40 or more boxes, this usually happens 4-5 times a year.

I usually consider a task worthy of a checkbox if it takes 15-20 minutes. At any time, when I look back on my last week, it feels great to see that several days are marked with these celebratory tags.

Note that the goal is *not* to reach 30 or 40 checked boxes each day. The goal is to cross off 20 checkboxes, because that's a sustainable pace. Checking 30 or more boxes in a day *feels* really good then and there, but inevitably means you'll do less tomorrow because you'll be tired. Don't burn out. Keep a sustainable pace.
